# SMART-PARKING-LOT-SYSTEM-USING-VERILOG-HDL

An automated Smart Parking Lot Management System designed using Verilog HDL, capable of handling vehicle entry, exit, slot allocation, time-based billing, and payment-validated exit control without manual intervention.

This project demonstrates how digital logic design and FSM-based control can be applied to real-world smart infrastructure and IoT automation problems.

### Project Overview

Traditional parking systems rely heavily on manual operation, leading to inefficiency, delays, and billing errors. This project proposes a hardware-driven automated parking solution that:

Allocates parking slots dynamically

Tracks real-time occupancy

Calculates parking fees based on duration

Prevents vehicle exit until payment is confirmed

Handles edge cases like full parking and invalid exit requests

The system is fully modeled and verified using Verilog HDL simulations.
